## About Me

I am a software quality engineer with extensive experience in both manual and automated testing, focused on ensuring the highest quality in every project. I have worked on both frontend and backend testing, which allows me to deliver robust and reliable products.

I specialize in performance testing and have a strong background in web development. My experience ranges from creating test cases to implementing automation frameworks, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy in testing processes. I have collaborated with teams across various areas to optimize the performance and stability of critical applications.

In the CI/CD domain, I have experience using Jenkins, optimizing and managing continuous integration and automated deployment pipelines. This approach has been key to identifying issues in a timely manner, improving both software quality and delivery efficiency.

Additionally, I have experience in robotic process automation (RPA), where I have implemented innovative solutions to enhance workflows and ensure the continuous delivery of high-quality products.
